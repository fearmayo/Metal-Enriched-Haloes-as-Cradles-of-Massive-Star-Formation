 \indent Further, high resolution hydrodynamic simulations will be required to
determine the fraction of metal-enriched haloes which can support SMS formation and in particular
 
whether pockets of metal-poor gas in these haloes can support SMS formation. Clearly, if metals
  become mixed efficiently then these haloes are unsuitable as candidates for SMS formation (we see
no observational evidence of SMS formation in present day low metallicity galaxies). However,
the galaxies studied here are embyronic and have had very few dynamical times in which the
gas mixing can take place and hence metal-poor pockets are much more likely. The addition of (some)
metal-enriched haloes to the number density of direct collapse black hoel candidate haloes
would help relieve the current tensions that exist in understanding the formation pathways for
high-z quasars.
