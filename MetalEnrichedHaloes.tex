\begin{abstract}
  The formation of super-massive stars has generally being studied under the assumptions of rapid
  accretion of pristine near metal-free gas. Recently it was suggested, however, that gas enriched to
  the level of $Z \lesssim 10^{-3}$ \zsolar can also facilitate super-massive star formation
  as long as the total mass infall rate onto the proto-star is not affected. We extend the
  analysis further by examining
  how the abundance of supermassive star candidate haloes would be affected in the case where
  haloes, with super-critical infall rates, with all levels of metallicity
  are included. We investigate this scenario by identifying all atomic cooling haloes in the
  Renaissance simulations with mass infall rates in their centres exceeding 0.1 \msolaryrc. 
  We find that of all of the
  haloes with mass infall rates greater than  0.1 (1.0) \msolaryrc, in their centre, approximately
  81\% (60\%) have metallicities of $Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolar. If metal mixing within these haloes is
  inefficient early in their assembly and pockets of metal-poor gas can remain then the
  number of super-massive star candidate haloes can be increased by up to an order of magnitude or more.
  Additionally these high in-fall rate haloes provide ideal environments in which to grow
  pre-existing black holes in the halo centres. In any case further research into the star
  formation dynamics of high mass infall haloes, with in-homogeneous
  metal distributions, is therefore encouraged to gain more insight into both super-massive star
  formation in early galaxies as well as early black hole growth.

\section{Introduction} \label{Sec:Introduction}
Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) with masses exceeding $10^{9}$ \msolar have long being known to
exist at high redshift \citep[e.g.][]{Fan_2001, Dietrich_2002, Fan_2003, Vestergaard_2004,
  Fan_2004, Fan_06}. The number of quasars, powered by SMBHs, at $z > 6$ now exceeds
200 \citep{Matsuoka_2019} and their number
density is estimated to be approximately 1 Gpc$^{-3}$. These 200 or so observed quasars probably
represent the tip of the iceberg with many more quasars of lower luminosity (and hence perhaps mass)
lurking below the observational threshold of current telescopes. \\
\indent Nonetheless, the discovery of even this relatively small number of high redshift SMBHs
has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of the formation and growth of black holes.
Black holes are believed to form as the end point of massive stars (see for example
\cite{Volonteri_2010a} and references therein). The seed black hole may then grow through the
accretion of gas or through mergers with other black holes. The significant challenge in this
scenario is that SMBHs with masses of up to $10^{9}$ \msolar exist \citep[e.g][]{Banados_2018} already when
the Universe was less than 1 billion years old. Our current understanding of black hole accretion
therefore makes these observations difficult to interpret. Three mainstream scenarios have
emerged over the past two decades in an attempt to understand the origin of high-z SMBHs. \\
\indent Perhaps the most straight forward scenario is that all black holes emerge from the end
point of the first generation of stars. While the initial mass function (IMF) of the first stars
is currently unknown, and as yet we have no observational guidance, simulations point to an IMF that
is top heavy compared to present day star formation \citep{Yoshida_2006, Turk_2009,
  Clark_2011a, Hirano_2014}. While initial studies of Population III (PopIII) star formation
concluded that the masses of the first stars were of the order of 100 \msolar \citep{Bromm_1999,
  Abel_2002, Bromm_2002} more recent studies indicate a characteristic mass of a few tens of solar
masses but with a range into the hundreds of solar masses \citep{Stacy_2010, Stacy_2012, Stacy_2014,
  Hirano_2014}. A black hole born from such stars will have at most the same mass as the
progenitor star and hence the black hole seed will have a mass of somewhere in the region of a
few tens to a few hundred solar masses. Such a black hole will need to increase its mass by up to
eight orders of magnitude within a few hundred million years if it is to grow to become a SMBH. Such
a scenario has been shown to be exceedingly unlikely. Black holes born from PopIII remnants tend to
be born starving, finding themselves in underdense regions away from the centre of the halo in
which they live \citep{Whalen_2004, Milosavljevic_2009, Alvarez_2009, Smith_2018}. The black holes
are unable to grow efficiently and suffer accretion rates orders of magnitudes below the Eddington
rate until its host halo is replenished with gas. It would seem that only in the cases where these 
black holes can grow at rates significant
exceeding the Eddington limit can these black holes reach sufficiently high masses. While the
super-Eddington accretion scenario remains viable \citep{Madau_2001, Madau_2014, Alexander_2014,
  Lupi_2016}, it is also predicted to be both very rare \citep{Pacucci_2017}, and it is also unclear
whether it can actually occur at all in nature or with a sufficient duty cycle. Seed black holes born
from the remnants of the first are known as light seeds.\\
\indent Next there is the heavy seed scenario which creates black holes with initial masses of
greater than 1000 \msolar and possibly up to $10^{6}$ \msolarc. Two scenarios have been
explored in some detail for forming heavy seeds. The first is the collapse of a dense
nuclear star cluster \citep{PortegiesZwart_2004, Freitag_2008, Devecchi_2008, Merritt_2008,
  Davies_2011, Lupi_2014}. In this case the compact nature of the cluster allows
stellar collisions to dominate resulting in the formation of a very massive seed at the
centre of the halo. Detailed numerical simulations have now being conducted \cite[e.g.][]{Katz_2015,
  Reinoso_2018} of this scenario and
most studies have converged on a final mass of the central object of approximately 1000 \msolarc.
Whether this scenario can ultimately produce SMBHs at early times in the Universe is as of yet
unclear and further research of this scenario is still required. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\indent The next heavy seed scenario is arguably the most well studied. In this scenario very high
mass accretion rates onto embryonic proto-stars allows for the creation of super-massive stars (SMSs)
\citep{Shapiro_1979, Begelman_2008, Schleicher_2013, Hosokawa_2013, Inayoshi_2014, Sakurai_2016,
  Umeda_2016, Haemmerle_2017,Woods_2017, Woods_2018, Regan_2018b}. \cite{Sakurai_2016} calculated
that a critical mass accretion rate of 0.04 \msolaryr is required to create a SMS.
Once this level of accretion is maintained the stellar atmosphere can inflate and the star becomes
bloated, causing the surface temperatures to drop to approximately 5000 K \citep{Hosokawa_2013, 
Woods_2017}. \\
\indent In order to achieve the large accretion rates required the general assumption has been
that a metal-free atomic cooling halo is required.
With the mass accretion rate onto a halo scaling as $dM/dt \propto T^{3/2}$ such haloes would appear
to be optimal regions to support high mass infall. The absence of metals removes a cooling pathway for
the gas which would otherwise potentially cause the gas to cool and fragment into smaller, lower
mass, stars thus preventing the formation of a massive central object. A further criteria is that the
atomic cooling halo should have had no previous episode of star formation (which would have
internally enriched the halo with metals). In order to achieve such a pristine halo the \molH content
also must be suppressed. Many studies have investigated pathways to achieve this, the main pathways
investigated have been to employ strong Lyman-Werner (LW) fluxes \citep{Dijkstra_2008, Shang_2010,
  Regan_2014b, Latif_2014b, Agarwal_2015a, Latif_2015, Regan_2016a, Regan_2017, Regan_2018a},
baryonic streaming velocities
\citep{Tseliakhovich_2010, Tanaka_2014, Hirano_2017, Schauer_2017}, collisions of massive
proto-galaxies \citep{Mayer_2010, Mayer_2014, Inayoshi_2015} and finally dynamically heating caused
by a succession of minor and major mergers \citep{Yoshida_2003a, Fernandez_2014, Wise_2019}. \\
\indent The goal of this study is to examine the role that metal-poor haloes may play in the
formation of SMSs. We follow the existing literature on metal-poor stars \citep[e.g.][]{Frebel_2015}
and adopt their terminology and assign the following terms to halo metallicitites:
metal-free $\equiv Z < 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc,
extremely metal-poor (EMP) $\equiv 10^{-5} < Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc,
metal-enriched\footnote{The metal-poor stars community traditionally refers to stars with
  metallicities of $Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolar as metal-poor stars but we use metal-enriched here as it
  is more appropriate in this context.} $\equiv Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc. Haloes with metallicities of
greater than 0.1 \zsolar do not appear in our simulations and hence we do not classify them.
To access the demographics of each population at high redshift we examine the Renaissance datasets
and look for haloes that display high mass infall
  rates towards the centre of the halo regardless of the metallicity of the halo. Previously, as
  discussed above, the focus of studies has been on metal-free haloes. What we do here is expand
  the search for supermassive star candidate haloes into the regime of those haloes which were
  previously enriched above $Z = 10^5$ \zsolarc. The formation of SMSs in metal enriched haloes
  has recently being
  investigated by \cite{Chon_2020}. They used high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics
  simulations to show that even in cases where the gas metallicity is 
    $Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolar that SMSs can still form. \cite{Chon_2020} showed that the pathway to
    formation varies somewhat between the purely metal-free case ($Z < 1 \times 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc) and
    the extremely metal-poor case  ($10^{-5} <  Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc). They found that as the 
    metallicity approached the upper limit here that SMS formation was prevented but that at
    $Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolar the end result remains the same - the formation
  of a massive central object with average accretion rates of approximately 0.1 \msolaryrc.
  Taking these results into account we therefore examine the Renaissance datasets looking
  for the highest infall haloes across all outputs while also examining their metallicities. 

\section{Renaissance Datasets} \label{Sec:RenaissanceDatasets}
The Renaissance Simulations were carried out on the Blue Waters supercomputer facility using the
adaptive mesh refinement code \enzo\citep{Enzo_2014, Enzo_2019}\footnote{https://enzo-project.org/}. \enzo
has been extensively used to study the formation of structure in the early universe
\citep{Abel_2002, OShea_2005b, Turk_2012, Wise_2012b, Wise_2014, Regan_2015, Regan_2017}. In particular
\enzo includes a ray tracing scheme to follow the propagation of radiation from star formation and
black hole formation \citep{WiseAbel_2011} as well as a detailed multi-species chemistry model that
tracks the formation and evolution of nine species \citep{Anninos_1997, Abel_1997, Grackle}. In
particular the photo-dissociation of \molH is followed, which is a critical ingredient for
determining the formation of the first metal-free stars \citep{Abel_2000}. 

The datasets used in this study were originally derived from a simulation of the universe in a 28.4
\mpch on the side box using the WMAP7 best fit cosmology. Initial conditions were generated using
MUSIC \citep{Hahn_2011} at z = 99. A low resolution simulation was run until z = 6 in order to
identify three different regions for re-simulation \citep{Chen_2014}. The volume was then smoothed
on a physical scale of 5 comoving Mpc, and regions of high
($\langle\delta\rangle \equiv \langle\rho\rangle(\Omega_{\rm M} \rho_{\rm c}) - 1 \simeq 0.68$),
average ($\langle\delta\rangle \sim 0.09)$), and low ($\langle\delta\rangle \simeq -0.26)$)
mean density were chosen for re-simulation. These sub-volumes were then referred to as the
\rarepeak region, the \normal region  and the \void region. The \rarepeak region has a comoving
volume of 133.6 Mpc$^3$, and the \normal and \void regions both have comoving volumes of 220.5
Mpc$^3$. Each region was then re-simulated with an effective initial resolution of $4096^3$ grid
cells and particles within these sub-volumes of the larger initial simulation. This gives a maximum
dark matter particle mass resolution of $2.9 \times 10^4$ \msolarc. For the re-simulations of the
\voidc, \normal and \rarepeak regions further refinement was allowed throughout the sub-volumes up
to a maximum refinement level of 12, which corresponded to 19 pc comoving spatial resolution. Given
that the regions focus on different over-densities each region was evolved forward in time to
different epochs. The \rarepeak region, being the most over-dense and hence the most
computationally demanding at earlier times, was run until z = 15. The \normal region ran until z =
11.6, and the \void region ran until z = 8. In all of the regions the halo mass function was very
well resolved down to M$_{\rm halo} \sim 2 \times 10^6$ \msolarc. The \rarepeak region represents a
region which is 1.65 times denser than the cosmic mean - therefore at z = 15, regions of the
size and overdensity of the \rarepeak are expected to be found in approximately 0.01 \%–0.1 \%
of the volume of the Universe \citep{Wise_2019}. Therefore, any results from the
\rarepeak region need to be viewed in the context of the region being rare ($\sim 100$ times
rarer than the \normal region).
The \rarepeak regions contained 822 galaxies with masses larger than $2 \times 10^7$ \msolar
at z = 15, the \normal region contained 758 such galaxies at z = 11.6, while the \void region
contained 458 such galaxies at z = 8. In this study we examine only the \rarepeak and \normal
regions. The \void region is not studied here as this region is not expected to 
host a large number of high-infall haloes. In our previous work
\citep{Wise_2019, Regan_2019} the void region was found to be devoid of metal-free and
star-free atomic cooling haloes as infall rates
did not support their formation. For this reason we excluded the 
\void region from study here.

\subsection{Results} \label{Sec:Results}

As discussed in \S \ref{Sec:RenaissanceDatasets} the \rarepeak dataset represents an overdense
region of the Universe with a large selection of galaxies while the \normal region represents a
region with an average density comparable to the cosmic mean. We begin our analysis of those two
datasets by examining only those galaxies which lie inside the high resolution region and which
have masses greater than the atomic cooling limit. In this work we define the atomic cooling
limit as
\begin{equation}
  M_{\rm atm} = 2 \times 10^{7} \Big ( \frac{\rm{T_{vir}}}{10^4}  \frac{1 + z}{21} \Big )^{-1.5} \rm{M_{\odot}}
\end{equation}
where M$_{\rm atm}$ is the atomic cooling limit mass and $z$ is the redshift.
This definition for the atomic limit is taken from \cite{Fernandez_2014}. During our analysis
we tested other definitions of the limit \citep[e.g.][]{Bromm_2011} which give larger
values for the limit by up to a factor of 2 or more. The number of metal-free and metal-free haloes
is very sensitive to the precise value chosen. We chose a value here consistent with previous
work in the literature but we note that higher limits can impact on the results. We will return to
this point in \S \ref{Sec:Discussion}.
For both datasets, we then filter each halo based on the mass infall rate onto that halo.
We calculate the instantaneous mass infall rate using the standard continuity equation:
\begin{equation}  
  \dot{M} = 4 \pi R^2 \rho(R) V_{\rm rad}(R)
\end{equation}
where  $\dot{M}$ is the mass infall rate, R is the radius at which the infall rate is calculated,
$\rho(R)$ is the gas density at that radius and $V_{\rm rad}(R)$ is the radial velocity at that radius.
For both the \rarepeak and \normal region the mass infall rate is calculated as the median
infall rate within 20 pc of the centre of the halo. 20 pc was chosen so as to give a large enough
colume over which to calculate the median. \\
\indent The \rarepeak simulation was run until a redshift of 15 but we
examine all of the outputs\footnote{There are 40 \rarepeak outputs between $z = 24$ and $z = 15$.}
from the dataset. For the \normal datasets we adopt the exact same procedure except that
the \normal simulation runs until z = 11.6 and again we examine all of the
outputs\footnote{There are 70 \normal outputs between $z = 24$ and $z = 15$.}.\\
\indent For the \rarepeak haloes at the final output time ($z = 15$) we find that there are
50 haloes with mass infall rates greater than 1 \msolaryr while in the \normal region at its final
output time ($z = 11.6$) we find that there are 20 haloes with mass infall rates
greater than 1 \msolaryrc. However, to be more comprehensive we examine all 110 outputs available to
us across both the \rarepeak and \normal regions and examine the infall rate in each of the haloes,
with masses greater than the atomic cooling limit, in each output. \\

\subsection{Central mass infall rates}
\indent We first plot the mass infall rate of each halo against three different halo
characteristics. First in Figure \ref{Fig:Scatter} we show a scatter plot of the mass infall rates
against the inner halo temperature. Secondly in Figure \ref{Fig:HaloMass} we plot the halo infall
rate against the total halo mass, and finally in Figure  \ref{Fig:StellarMass} we show the halo
infall rate against the stellar mass of each halo. We begin by analysing Figure \ref{Fig:Scatter}. \\
\indent In the left panel of Figure \ref{Fig:Scatter} we show the results from the \rarepeak
simulation and in the right panel the results from the \normal simulation. Each point shows the mass
infall rate averaged over the inner 20 pc of each atomic cooling halo for the \rarepeak
and \normal region. The mass infall rates are plotted against the average temperature within
the same region in each halo. There are two colour codes on the plot. The grayscale
hexbins capture all metallicities\footnote{Note that all metallicities
  referred to in this paper are gas phase metallicities.}
greater than $Z = 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc. Each coloured circle then refers to
the metallicities of the metal-poor and metal-free haloes. Red circles indicate
mildly metal enriched regions ( \zsolar $10^{-5} \lesssim Z \lesssim 10^{-3}$ \zsolar )
while blue circles indicate metal poor regions  ( $Z \lesssim 10^{-5}$ \zsolar ). We also
include green circles on the plot to indicate haloes which are completely metal-free and star-free. \\
\indent Some results are immediately clear from a comparison of the panels in Figure
\ref{Fig:Scatter}. The \rarepeak region clearly has significantly more haloes that have lower
metallicities (and/or are metal-free) and it also has more haloes
with high infall rates. Nonetheless, while there are a number of high mass infall,
metal-poor haloes, in the \rarepeak region - the highest mass infall halo is infact metal-enriched
and there are comparable numbers of high infall haloes which are both metal-enriched and metal-free.
The metal-free and star-free haloes (green circles) show a strong scatter and are not preferentially
high accretors. The metal-free and star-free haloes do populate the lower temperature parts of the
phase space however and this is because they have no ongoing star formation (by definition) and so
the temperature of the gas is determined purely by the competition between gas cooling and
dynamical and compressional heating. The other metal-poor haloes, especially those with temperatures
close to T = $10^4$ K are likely being heated by ongoing star formation with atomic line
cooling keeping the temperature close to, or slightly below, T = $10^4$ K. 
The haloes in the \normal region are in general much more metal enriched. Infact of
all of the haloes plotted only 84 ($\sim 5$\%) of  haloes have metallicites
below  $Z = 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc. The prevalence of metal enrichment is clearly much stronger in
the \normal region.\\
\indent In Figure \ref{Fig:HaloMass} we plot the mass infall rate against the total (dark matter
+ gas) halo mass. In this representation the metal-poor haloes are strongly clustered, in both
the \rarepeak and \normal regions, at the atomic cooling limit (M$_{\rm atm} \sim 2 - 5 \times 10^7$
\msolarc). This result is not surprising - once the atomic cooling limit is reached star formation
will begin (if it hasn't already) and from that point onwards it is only a matter of time before
the halo becomes metal enriched. Complementary to this is Figure \ref{Fig:StellarMass}
where we plot the mass infall rate against the stellar mass. In the left panel of Figure
\ref{Fig:StellarMass} we show the scatter/hexbin plot, coloured by metallicity, of the
\rarepeak region. There is a large cluster of metal-free haloes, with $Z \lesssim 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc,
with stellar masses of M$_{*} \lesssim 10^3$ \msolarc. These are haloes
populated with PopIII stars and the majority are metal-free ($Z \lesssim 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc).
It should also be noted that this group of haloes also contain some of the highest mass infall
rates. The \normal region contains significantly fewer metal-free haloes ($Z < 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc).
Similarly, to the \rarepeak region, the majority have stellar masses
with M$_{*} \lesssim 10^3$ \msolarc.  From Figures \ref{Fig:Scatter}, \ref{Fig:HaloMass}
and \ref{Fig:StellarMass} we see that there exists a sizeable minority of high mass infall haloes
which are metal-free ($Z < 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc). These
haloes, due to their large mass infall rates, makes them strong candidates for super-massive
star formation \citep{Woods_2018, Chon_2020}. However, equally there exists a large population of
high mass-infall, metal enriched, haloes. Some of these haloes could potentially support SMS formation
if the metal mixing within the halo is inhomogeneous. We will discuss this point further in \S
\ref{Sec:Discussion}. First we quantify the relative ratios of metal-enriched, extremely metal-poor
and metal-enriched haloes in Figure \ref{Fig:Histogram}.

\subsection{The abundance of metal-free, extremely metal-poor and metal-enriched haloes}
In Figure \ref{Fig:Histogram} we show the cumulative number of haloes with infall rates greater than
the given value on the x-axis. The x-axis runs from $\dot{M}(R) = 10^{-4}$ \msolaryr to 
$\dot{M}(R) = 10^{1}$ \msolaryrc. As the plot runs from left to right the number of haloes with a
mass infall rate greater than a given value diminishes as expected. The mass infall rate,
$\dot{M}(R)$, is calculated as the average value within 10 pc of the centre for the \rarepeak region
and within 50 pc of the centre for the \normal region. In Figure  \ref{Fig:Histogram} the
\rarepeak region is shown in the left panel while the \normal region is shown in the right hand
panel. Bars in each panel are coloured as follows: red bars are for metal-enriched haloes with
metallicities ($Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc), grey bars are for haloes with ($Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc) and
blue bars are for haloes with ($Z < 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc). In total there are 3212 haloes found
across all outputs in the \rarepeak region and 1434 haloes found across all outputs in the
\normal region. \\
\indent Concentrating first on the \rarepeak region we see that there are a small number of
haloes ($\sim 87$) with mass infall rates greater than 1 \msolaryrc. Among these (high-accreting)
haloes most are metal-poor (69\%). EMP haloes with between
($10^{-3}$ \zsolar $> Z > 10^{-5}$ \zsolarc) only add slightly (i.e. difference in height between the
blue and grey bars) to the total number of haloes that
have been shown to result in SMS formation \citep{Chon_2020}. As we move along the histogram to the
left and concentrate on haloes with mass infall rates greater than 0.1 \msolaryr we see the
number of metal enriched haloes grow compared to
metal-poor haloes. If we allow all haloes (independent of metallicity) with mass infall rates greater
than  0.1 \msolaryr to be super-massive star candidates then the number of candidate haloes can
increase by a factor of two compared to the metal-free case. We will
come back to this point in \S \ref{Sec:Discussion}. \\
\indent In the right hand panel of Figure \ref{Fig:Histogram}
we show the same histogram for the \normal region. In this case there is only 1 metal-free halo
with a mass infall rate greater than 1 \msolaryr and only 3 metal-enriched haloes for the
same mass infall rate. In the \normal region the haloes are dominated by metal-enriched haloes.
On the face of it this suggests that the \normal region will
support only a small number of super-massive star candidates. However, similar to the \rarepeak
if we relax the criteria for super-massive star formation and consider also metal-enriched haloes
then the number of possible candidate haloes can increase by a factor of over a 10 in the \normal
region when considering haloes with mass infall rates, $\dot{M} > 0.1 $ \msolaryrc. 



\subsection{The Highest Accretors}
\indent We next assess the ten highest accreting haloes, independent of metallicity, in each region.
In Figure \ref{Fig:RadialProfiles} we plot the radial profiles of each of the highest
accreting haloes.
%Haloes are excluded from the plot if they have undergone a recent supernovae explosion or other
%feedback processes which make computing a mass infall rate 
In each figure we show the temperature, \molH fraction, mass infall rates and
metallicity of each halo as a function of radius. The thick black line in each panel gives the
median value for the given quantity. Values across the two panels are broadly similar. Both regions
show gas phase metallicity values that range from completely metal-free (Z $\sim 10^{-16}$ \zsolarc)
into the metal-free regime and all the way through to those which are metal-enriched (Z $> 10^{-3}$
\zsolarc). Note that the metallicity sub-panel of each panel
is split between approximately extremely metal-poor and completely metal-free haloes. The dashed
line in the metallicity panel indicated the critical metallicity above which
SMS has being found by \cite{Chon_2020} to be precluded. Below this line SMS is possible if the
accretion rate is sufficient. Note also that each radial profile of the metallicity shows decreassing
metallicity towards the centre of the halo. For some haloes this decrease is highly pronounced,
particularly for the \normal region. These profiles give some evidence that metal mixing within
haloes is likely to be somewhat inhomogeneous. \\
\indent The mass in-fall rate is shown in the top right panel of each figure. 
Mass infall rates in both the \rarepeak and \normal regions, for these select haloes, are
comfortably above the critical value thought to be necessary for SMS formation (0.04
\msolaryr \citep{Sakurai_2016}) this is shown as the dashed black line in each mass-infall sub-panel.
While mass infall rates determined at this radius is in no
way a guarantee that this will lead to similar accretion rates onto a protostar, the high rates do
suggest that large amounts of matter are being transferred to the halo centre at least. \\
\indent In Figure \ref{Fig:GrowthRates} we plot the halo mass history of the high infall
rate haloes shown in Figure \ref{Fig:RadialProfiles} with the \rarepeak and \normal haloes
shown on left- and right-hand panels, respectively. In the panels we identify haloes which
are metal-enriched (Z $> 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc) and those below that threshold. The growth of
metal-enriched haloes are marker in red while those below the threshold are marked in black. Note
that haloes often tramnsition from metal-poor to metal-enriched during the course of their growth. 
Haloes can become metal-enriched either through internal star formation and
supernovae or alternatively can become metal enriched through external enrichement processes
\citep[e.g.][]{Smith_2015}. Where star formation first
occurs in a halo the redshift of star formation is denoted by a green star on the halo growth line. 
Haloes which remain completely star-free are marked as dashed lines. Finally, the blue line denoted
the halo which showed the highest instantaneous in-fall rate in the centre. \\
\indent In the \rarepeak region there are two
star-free haloes. One of these haloes becomes metal-enriched, although has yet to form
a star by the time the halo is detected as a high in-fall halo. The time of metal enrichement
compared to star formation is somewhat varied between haloes. Some haloes form stars and then
metal-enrichment follows (internal enrichement). In other cases metal-enrichement preceeds
star formation - as noted above.
However, given that these are relatively massive galaxies with deep potential wells
the metal mixing can be gradual in some haloes but more rapid in others as was shown in Figure
\ref{Fig:RadialProfiles}. The \normal region haloes in the right hand panel show similar trends.
The \normal region has no star-free haloes in this sub-set with all haloes undergoing at
least some star formation. 

\section{Discussion and Conclusions} \label{Sec:Discussion}
The goal of this paper is to examine the prevalence of high infall rate halos in the
Renaissance Simulations which in turn are thought to represent very accurately the
behaviour of structure formation in our Universe \citep{Chen_2014, Xu_2013, Xu_2014, OShea_2015,
  Barrow_2017, Wise_2019}. A high mass accretion rate onto an embryonic proto-star is the
single most important criteria for the formation of a SMS \citep{Hosokawa_2013, Sakurai_2016,
  Woods_2018}. Therefore, we examine the Renaissance datasets for haloes which are experiencing
rapid gas inflow in their centres. While, rapid gas inflow to the halo centre does not guarantee
that a SMS will ultimately form it is however very likely to be a necessary condition. \\
\indent Previous investigations of SMS candidate haloes\footnote{These haloes are also
  referred to as "direct collapse black hole" haloes in the literature due to the fact
  that the high in-fall rates are thought to lead to massive black hole formation in certain
  circumstances. However, current research indicates that the intermediary stage involves a
  SMS, with no supernova event, and hence we use that terminology here.} have almost
universally focused on
metal-free haloes in which the equation of state of the gas was determined by the gas phase
cooling mechanisms of hydrogen and helium. Here, we extend the analysis to haloes that are both
extremely metal-poor and metal-enriched. If the number density of haloes that support SMS formation
can be extended to include also non metal-free haloes (at least perhaps up to some
metallicity or due to metal enrichment inhomogeneity) then the
number density of candidate SMS host haloes will increase accordingly and so is of
immense interest to the community. Previous SMS candidate halo number densities have
tended to show that when including metal-free haloes only that the number of SMS candidate
haloes may be either insufficient or just sufficient to explain the number of density of
high-z quasars \citep{Agarwal_2012, Visbal_2014b, Agarwal_2015b, Latif_2014a,
  Valiante_2016, Habouzit_2016, Valiante_2017, Habouzit_2017, Regan_2017}. \\

\caption{The fraction of haloes which have metallicities of $Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolar,
  $Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolar and $ Z < 10^{-5}$ \zsolar and have mass infall rates greater than
  0.1 \msolaryrc. The vast majority of haloes ($\sim 93$\%) are metal enriched and hence within
  those haloes pockets of metal-poor gas will be required for SMS to occur. As the metallicity
  decreases the ability of haloes to form SMS for a given accretion rate increases. The fraction of
  metal enriched haloes also decreases with accretion rate (see Figure \ref{Fig:Histogram}).} \label{Fig:Fractions}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\indent \cite{Chon_2020} have recently shown, through dedicated high resolution numerical simulations
of the collapse of candidate SMS haloes that metallicities with $Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolar
are compatible with SMS formation. They showed that for metallicities of $Z \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ \zsolar
that the behaviour of SMS formation is the same as the metal-free case i.e. SMS formation results
directly from the rapid accretion of pristine gas. \cite{Tagawa_2020} came to similar conclusions
using a semi-analytic approach. \cite{Chon_2020} further showed that when the metallicity enters the
extremely metal-poor regime, $5 \times 10^{-5}$ \zsolar $ < Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc, then while
the gas does fragment, the fragments nonetheless coalesce onto the growing protostar and the
result is a SMS. In the case of higher metal enrichement,  $Z \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ \zsolar
they find that the gas cooling becomes too rapid and that the gas fragments into low mass fragments
and SMS formation is inhibited. However, there remains the possibility that even in these
metal-enriched haloes that pockets of metal-poor gas will remain in which SMS formation can occur.
Investigation of metal inhomogeniety was outside the scope of the \cite{Chon_2020} investigations
but given that metal-mixing has previously being shown to be inefficient
\citep[e.g.][]{Smith_2015} this (metal-enriched) scenario warrants further research. \\
\indent With this in mind we included all high mass infall haloes in our analysis regardless of
metallicity. To do this we examined the Renaissance datasets, analysing
both the \normal and \rarepeak regions. We analysed the simulation volumes and filtered atomic
cooling haloes by their instantaneous mass infall rates, averaged within 20 pc of the halo centre,
of each halo.  \\
\indent We found that, as expected, there is a large number of haloes with very high accretion rates
in the centre (see Figure \ref{Fig:Histogram}). At accretion rates
greater than 1.0 \msolaryr there are similar numbers of metal-free and metal-enriched haloes
(58\%:42\%) in the \rarepeak simulation. In the \normal region there are very few haloes with mass
infall rates exceeding 1.0 \msolaryr and are dominated by metal-enriched haloes. Relaxing the
mass infall criteria to 0.1 \msolaryr in both datasets we find that of these ``high-accreting''
haloes a majority of these haloes are either metal-enriched ($Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc) or
extremely metal-poor ($10^{-5}$ \zsolar $ < Z < 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc). In Figure \ref{Fig:Fractions}
we show the fraction of high accretion rate ($\dot{M} > 0.1$ \msolaryrc) haloes and
their (gas phase) metallicities for haloes from both the \normal and \rarepeak regions.
The \rarepeak haloes are displayed in orange, the \normal haloes in blue. For the \rarepeak
region the majority (65\%) are metal-enriched (i.e. $Z > 10^{-3}$ \zsolarc) with 35\% extremely
metal-poor or metal-free. For the \normal region the vast
majority (81\%) are metal enriched with only 19\% being extremely metal-poor or metal-free.
Since the \normal region represents an average
region of the Universe the results for the \normal region are more representative of typical
regions likely to be observed, at least by upcoming wide-field surveys although not at the high
redshifts probed in this study. Nonetheless, 
in the optimistic case where all of these metal-enriched haloes support SMS formation the boost to
candidate haloes for SMS formation, compared to the metal-free case, is up to one order of
magnitude. While, some of these haloes may ultimately be shown through high resolution simulation
to not support SMS formation their high mass infall rates will at a minimum transfer a large
baryon content towards the halo centre which may impact the initial mass function and is worth
further investigation. Furthermore, such high-infall rate haloes may support the rapid growth of less massive, pre-existing,
black holes. \\
\indent Additional high resolution hydrodynamic simulations will be required to
determine the fraction of metal-enriched haloes which can support SMS formation and in particular
whether pockets of metal-poor gas in these haloes can support SMS formation. There are clear
indications form our analysis of the halo radial profiles (see Figure \ref{Fig:RadialProfiles} that
metal mixing decreases strongly towards the halo centre. If this mixing inefficiency persists
then metal inhomogenitety may be common in these young galaxies. The galaxies studied here are
embryonic and have had very few dynamical times in which the
gas mixing can take place and hence metal-poor pockets are much more likely than in the general case.
The addition of (some) metal-enriched haloes to the number density of SMS
candidate haloes would help relieve the current tensions that exist in understanding the formation
pathways for high-z quasars.
